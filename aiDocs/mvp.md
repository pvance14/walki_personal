# Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Specification

## Walki - Web-Based Interactive Demo

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 11, 2026  
**Status:** Ready for Development  
**Author:** Preston Vance

---

## Executive Summary

This MVP is a **web-based interactive demo** designed to validate the core value proposition of Walki: AI-powered personas that motivate users to maintain walking streaks. Rather than building a full mobile app, this demo allows stakeholders, potential users, and advisors to experience the personality-driven motivation system in a shareable, rapidly iterable format.

**Goal:** Validate that the AI persona concept resonates with users before investing 3+ months in mobile development.

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks  
**Platform:** Responsive web app (desktop and mobile browser compatible)  
**Deployment:** Static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages)

---

## What We're Validating

### Primary Validation Goals

1. **Persona Appeal:** Do users find the six personas genuinely motivating/entertaining?
2. **Quiz Effectiveness:** Does the motivation quiz accurately capture user preferences?
3. **Concept Clarity:** Do people immediately understand the value proposition?
4. **Emotional Response:** Do the notifications make people smile, laugh, or feel motivated?
5. **Shareability:** Will people share their quiz results or favorite notifications?

### Secondary Validation Goals

1. Streak visualization appeal
2. Notification timing preferences
3. Persona weight customization interest
4. Privacy messaging resonance
5. Overall UX and aesthetic

### What We're NOT Validating

❌ Real step tracking accuracy  
❌ Long-term retention (can't measure in a demo)  
❌ Native mobile UX  
❌ Actual behavior change (whether people walk more)  
❌ Notification delivery in real life  
❌ Backend scalability

  id: string;
  persona: string;
  template: string;  // e.g., "Hey! You're on a {{streak_length}}-day streak!"
  contextRequired: string[];  // ["streak_length", "steps_remaining"]
  tags: string[];  // ["morning", "milestone", "encouraging"]

## Notification Message Library

### Message Generation Strategy

**Pre-generate 300+ messages** (50 per persona) covering:

**Contexts:**

- Morning motivation (hasn't walked yet)
- Evening reminder (below goal)
- Close to goal (within 1,000 steps)
- Goal reached (celebration)
- Streak milestones (7, 14, 30 days)
- Weekday vs. weekend
- Weather-based (rainy, sunny - optional)

**Example Messages Per Persona:**

**The Companion (50 messages):**

1. "Good morning, friend! Ready to add another day to that {{streak_length}}-day streak? ☀️"
2. "Hey! You're {{steps_remaining}} steps away from your goal. That's only {{minutes_remaining}} minutes!"
3. "I'm so proud of you for keeping this up. Day {{streak_length}} is no joke! 💙"
4. "Tough day? A walk might help clear your head. I'll be with you."

## Post-MVP Next Steps

### Validation Outcomes

**If validation is POSITIVE (>20% waitlist conversion, strong feedback):**

1. Begin mobile app development (React Native)
2. Generate full 300+ message library with AI assistance
3. Build backend infrastructure (user accounts, cloud sync)
4. Design production-ready UI/UX
5. Plan beta launch timeline

**If validation is MIXED (10-20% conversion, some concerns):**

1. Conduct deeper user interviews
2. Iterate on personas (remove/add/refine)
3. Test different messaging styles
4. A/B test quiz questions
5. Revisit value proposition

**If validation is NEGATIVE (<10% conversion, poor feedback):**

1. Pivot: Consider different differentiator (not personas)
2. Research: What DID resonate?
3. Simplify: Maybe just 2-3 personas instead of 6?
4. Alternative: Partner with existing app instead of building new one

### Key Questions to Answer

After 100+ demo users:

- Which personas are most popular? (Should we drop any?)
- Do users actually adjust persona weights, or stick with quiz results?
- Which messages get the best reactions? (Funny, motivational, factual?)
- Is the streak freeze concept clear and appealing?
- Do people understand the privacy angle? Does it matter to them?
- What concerns or objections do people have?
- Would people actually pay $6.99-9.99/month for this?

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Quiz feels too long or boring

**Mitigation:**

- Keep to 10 questions max
- Make questions scenario-based (engaging, not clinical)
- Add progress indicator
- Allow "Back" button to revise answers

### Risk 2: Personas feel gimmicky

**Mitigation:**

- High-quality message writing (not generic)
- Test messages with 10+ people before launch
- Show variety in showcase (each persona has range)
- Make examples funny/memorable

### Risk 3: Demo doesn't communicate real app value

**Mitigation:**

- Add "This is just a taste" messaging
- Include animations and celebrations (make it feel alive)
- Context-aware messages (show personalization working)
- Clear "Coming to mobile soon" CTAs

### Risk 4: Low waitlist conversion

**Mitigation:**

- A/B test CTA placement and copy
- Offer incentive: "Early access for first 1,000 signups"
- Make sharing easy and rewarding
- Follow up: "Thanks for signing up—here's what's next"

### Risk 5: Technical issues (bugs, slow load)

**Mitigation:**

- Test thoroughly on multiple devices/browsers
- Use error boundaries in React
- Implement loading states for all async actions
- Monitor with Sentry for error tracking

---

## Open Questions

- Should we include a "dark mode" toggle? (Nice-to-have)
- Should demo data be randomized per user, or consistent? (Leaning consistent for easier demo)
- Should we show ads in the demo (freemium model preview)? (No - keep it clean)
- Should we include a "refer a friend" mechanism? (Yes - drives growth)
- How much should we spend on paid ads to drive traffic to demo? (Start with $0, test organic first)

## Appendix: Example User Journey

### Sarah's Experience (Target User)

**1. Discovery (2 minutes on landing page)**

- Sarah sees a Twitter post: "This walking app has 6 AI personalities and it's hilarious"
- Clicks link, lands on demo site
- Reads headline: "Your Walking Buddy Has Six Personalities"
- Intrigued: "Okay this sounds different"
- Scrolls, sees persona names: "Wait, there's a Pessimist? I need to see this"

- Smiles: "Okay that's cute"
- Clicks again: Gets Cheerleader message: "OMG 753 STEPS LEFT! YOU'RE CRUSHING IT!"
- Laughs out loud
- Clicks again: Gets Pessimist: "753 steps. You'll probably blow it by staying on this demo instead of actually walking."
- "OKAY I love this"
- Explores calendar view, sees streak history
- Goes to Personas tab, adjusts sliders (increases Pessimist to 20%)
- Clicks "Get Motivation" hoping for more Pessimist
- Gets one, screenshots it
- Opens Settings, sets daily goal to 8,000

**5. Conversion (30 seconds)**

- Sees "Join Waitlist" CTA
- Thinks: "I would actually use this"
- Enters email
- Shares on Twitter: "Just tried this walking app demo with AI personas and I'm obsessed. The Pessimist one is chef's kiss 👌"

**Total time:** 10-12 minutes  
**Outcome:** Waitlist signup + social share = SUCCESS

---

## Summary

This MVP is designed to validate the core hypothesis: **AI personas make walking motivation more engaging and effective than generic fitness apps.** By building a web-based demo instead of a full mobile app, we can:

1. ✅ Test the concept in 2 weeks instead of 3 months
2. ✅ Get feedback from 100+ users before investing in mobile development
3. ✅ Iterate rapidly based on what resonates
4. ✅ Build a waitlist for launch
5. ✅ Create shareable content for organic growth

**If the demo validates the concept (>20% waitlist conversion), we proceed to full mobile app development. If not, we pivot or refine based on feedback.**
