# Multi-Tool AI Agent - Individual Project
---

Build a multi-tool chatbot agent using LangChain.js that demonstrates the ReAct pattern. This is an individual assignment spanning Dev Units 7 and 8.

## What You're Building
A chatbot agent with:

1. Calculator tool - evaluates math expressions
2. Web search tool - searches the web using Tavily
3. RAG tool - vector search over at least 5 real documents, with source attribution (response includes source of where information was found)
4. Conversation memory - multi-turn context (follow-up questions work)
5. Web UI - a chat web page (terminal fallback acceptable but not the target)
6. Streaming - recommended but not required

## Repo Requirements
Build this with proper development practices. We review your repo, not just whether the chatbot works.

- context.md -  orients AI tools to your project
- PRD - what the agent does, its tools, the problem it solves
- Roadmap - phased plan with progress tracked
- .gitignore - no secrets, no node_modules, etc 
- Structured logging - logging that shows tool calls, arguments, and results
- Incremental git history - 5+ meaningful commits showing progression (setup > tools > agent > UI > RAG > polish), not one dump
- README.md - what it does, how to run it


## Deliverables
- GitHub repo with proper infrastructure and incremental history
- Working agent - three tools + memory + web UI
- README.md
- 2-minute demo video - an unedited screen capture showing your agent's web UI in action with a couple of its tools/features. Doesn't need to be polished.
- Submit: GitHub repo link + demo video.

## Stretch Goals (Extra Credit)
- Streaming in the web UI 
- 4th custom tool 
- Persistent vector store - documents survive restarts 
- Agent proposal - ~1 page identifying a feature in one of your projects that would benefit from an agent pattern (or why your project wouldn't benefit at all from one - be thorough with your explanation if this is the case)
